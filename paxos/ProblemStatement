1. Implement a simple replicated bank application.
The bank service maintains a set of client
records, a set of accounts (a client can have zero
or more accounts), and operations such as deposit,
withdraw, transfer, inquiry.

2. Implement the failure detection scheme of Section
3 so that most of the time only one leader
is active.

3.Produce a scenario where the proposed solution allows a read operation 
to return stale data (i.e. return a value that has been already overwritten). 
You should provide a detailed description of an execution that can cause the 
issue and submit it in a document at the time your project is due.

4. Design a solution for the problem, and provide an implementation of the 
solution. Devise a demo to prove that your solution achieves the correct result.

Notes:

1. Show that state machine is taking unexpected time to transition?
    - Some kind of random or something has to be introduced.
2. This is a asynchronous environment, how would you show that there is crash failure? 
    - How to detect that kind of failure and how to simulate that environment?
3. What about clients?
    - Can either be in java or python.
    - Each would have on clientId and commandIdentifier for each command they send.
