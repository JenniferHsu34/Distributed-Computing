This a collection of distributed computing projects that I have done as a part of CS 380D Distributed computing course taught by Dr. ALivisi Lorenzo.

List of the projects:

1. Distributed playlist using 3-Phase commit for a synchronous system having crash-recover failures.
2. Distributed replicated bank using PAXOS. Obviously it is an asynchronous system, non-FIFO channels but only crash failures.
3. Distributed weakly replicated playlist database using Bayou. Implemented anti-entropy for READ your writes sessions.

All the projects have python clients to interact with the servers. One can configure the server list using playlist/config.properties files.

Cheers !!
