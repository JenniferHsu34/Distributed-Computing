This project is done is a part of the CS 380D Distributed computing course taught by Dr. ALivisi Lorenzo and
aims at building a distributed playlist using JAVA. 

1. Atomic commit protocol used here is 3-Phase commit. 
2. We also implement state recovery, including total failures.

We have included a python script, which can be used to interact with the playlist servers. 
One can configure the server list using config.properties files.

Cheers !!
