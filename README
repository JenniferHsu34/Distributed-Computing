This project is done is a part of the CS 380D Distributed computing course taught by Dr. ALivisi Lorenzo and aims at building a distributed playlist using JAVA. 

1. Atomic commit protocol used here is 3-Phase commit. 
2. We also implement state recovery, including total failures.

We have included a playlist/src/python/test_case.py script, which can be used to run demos and interact with the running playlist servers. 
One can configure the server list using playlist/config.properties files.

Cheers !!
